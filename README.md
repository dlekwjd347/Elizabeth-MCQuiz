# Elizabeth-MCQuiz

This timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions features a responsive layout, dynamic HTML and CSS powered by my Javascript code all on a clean and polished user interface. 


At the start of the quiz which is enabled by the Start Quiz button, you are presented with a question, and a timer set at 75 seconds starts counting down.

When the current question is answered, the next question will appear in its place. 

When questions are answered incorrectly, the timer will decrement by 5 seconds and no score will be noted.

When questions are answered correctly, the score will increase by 1 point.

When the timer reaches 0, the quiz is over. 

When all questions are answered, or when the timer reaches 0, the player's initials and scores can be saved to local storage and can be accessed on the View Highscores page.
